# Abstract 
Image classification and computer vision is one of
the most important topics in the Artificial Intelligence revolution.
Being able to identify and classify images and videos is a simple
task for a human brain but exceptionally difficult for traditional
machine learning algorithms and neural networks. Advances in
deep learning such as convolutional neural networks are breaking
the problem wide open. Four well-known CNNs are AlexNet,
ResNet, VGG and GoogLeNet. We propose that the structure of
a deep learning network will affect the performance on different
classification tasks. We have tested the performance on three
image datasets, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CelebA. The results of
our project have shown that different networks perform best on
each dataset. This shows that the architecture of a CNN effects
its performance on differing image classification problems
